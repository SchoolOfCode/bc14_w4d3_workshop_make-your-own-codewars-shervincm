ğŸ‘‰ Write your kata here!
Name: Sum pairs
In this test you will need to create a function that takes in an array of numbers and the target sum as
input, and return the first pair of integers that add up to the target sum.
If there are no paired integers, then the function should return 0.

Example: arr[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], targetSum: 9
Output = 3,6
In this example the first 2 integers to add up to 9 are 3 & 6

//ğŸ‘‰ Write the function your CodeWarriors will start with below here:
export function sumPairs(arr, targetSum){
    return
};
